# hello-world
I am new to the GitHub community 
Hello I am a systems administrator and I work a lot with VMwaer, Hosts, switches, and storage units allong with all sorts of other fun hardware and software. I joined GitHub because a sys admin buddy of mine said it was a great source for scripting, powershell, and so much more.
